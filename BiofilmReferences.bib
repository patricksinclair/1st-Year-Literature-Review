Formation of these sessile communities and their inherent resistance to antimicrobial agents are at the root of many persistent and chronic bacterial infections. Studies of biofilms have revealed differentiated, structured groups of cells with community properties. Recent advances in our understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of bacterial community behavior point to therapeutic targets that may provide a means for the control of biofilm infections.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is one of the best documented examples of contemporary biological evolution. Variability in the mechanisms of resistance depends on the diversity of genotypes in the huge bacterial populations, and also on the diversity of selective pressures that are produced along the antibiotic concentration gradients formed in the highly compartmentalized human body during therapy. These antibiotic gradients can be conceived as comprising selective compartments, each one of them defined as the concentration able to select a particular genetic variant. In vitro experimental models confirm that some antibiotic resistant variants are selected only at certain selective concentrations of antibiotics. The correspondence between selective compartments and selectable variants could offer a way of describing more accurately the antibiotic selective landscapes and for taking measures to prevent the development of a major threat to the future of modern medicine.},

  Abstract                 = {A new apparatus is described which serves to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of antibiotics as a function of different concentration time curves. The apparatus can be adjusted to simulate the biexponential serum level curves observed in vivo after oral or intramuscular administration. Preliminary studies were carried out with a cephalosporin derivative, cefazolin, against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp. strains simulating initial concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 μg/ml that decreased exponentially with half-lives of 30, 60, and 120 min. Surviving cells were counted at 1-h intervals for 10 h. In all the situations tested there was an initial phase of rapid bactericidal activity followed by a phase of bacteriostatic activity, whose length depended on the drug elimination rate but was relatively independent of the initial concentrations. Bacterial regrowth occurred when the antibiotic concentration fell below the minimum inhibitory concentration of the drug against the strains tested. The antibacterial activity of cefazolin, cephacetrile, and cephradine against E. coli and Klebsiella strains was also investigated, in a medium containing 4% human albumin, simulating the serum level curves observed in humans after an intramuscular dose of 1 g. The results obtained suggest that, for cephalosporins, a longer half-life might be more useful than higher peak levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Bacterial growth environment strongly influences the efficacy of antibiotic treatment, with slow growth often being associated with decreased susceptibility. Yet in many cases, the connection between antibiotic susceptibility and pathogen physiology remains unclear. We show that for ribosome‐targeting antibiotics acting on Escherichia coli, a complex interplay exists between physiology and antibiotic action; for some antibiotics within this class, faster growth indeed increases susceptibility, but for other antibiotics, the opposite is true. Remarkably, these observations can be explained by a simple mathematical model that combines drug transport and binding with physiological constraints. Our model reveals that growth‐dependent susceptibility is controlled by a single parameter characterizing the ‘reversibility’ of ribosome‐targeting antibiotic transport and binding. This parameter provides a spectrum classification of antibiotic growth‐dependent efficacy that appears to correspond at its extremes to existing binary classification schemes. In these limits, the model predicts universal, parameter‐free limiting forms for growth inhibition curves. The model also leads to non‐trivial predictions for the drug susceptibility of a translation mutant strain of E. coli, which we verify experimentally. Drug action and bacterial metabolism are mechanistically complex; nevertheless, this study illustrates how coarse‐grained models can be used to integrate pathogen physiology into drug design and treatment strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {The emergence of bacterial antibiotic resistance is a growing problem, yet the variables that influence the rate of emergence of resistance are not well understood. In a microfluidic device designed to mimic naturally occurring bacterial niches, resistance of Escherichia coli to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin developed within 10 hours. Resistance emerged with as few as 100 bacteria in the initial inoculation. Whole-genome sequencing of the resistant organisms revealed that four functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms attained fixation. Knowledge about the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance in the heterogeneous conditions within the mammalian body may be helpful in understanding the emergence of drug resistance during cancer chemotherapy.},
