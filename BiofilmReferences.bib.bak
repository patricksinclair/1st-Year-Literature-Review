  Abstract                 = {Bacterial biofilms are highly recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment, which holds serious consequences for therapy of infections that involve biofilms. The genetic mechanisms of this biofilm antibiotic resistance appear to fall into two general classes: innate resistance factors and induced resistance factors. Innate mechanisms are activated as part of the biofilm developmental pathway, the factors being integral parts of biofilm structure and physiology. Innate pathways include decreased diffusion of antibiotics through the biofilm matrix, decreased oxygen and nutrient availability accompanied by altered metabolic activity, formation of persisters, and other specific molecules not fitting into the above groups. Induced resistance factors include those resulting from induction by the antimicrobial agent itself. Biofilm antibiotic resistance is likely manifested as an intricate mixture of innate and induced mechanisms. Many researchers are currently trying to overcome this extreme biofilm antibiotic resistance by developing novel therapies aimed at disrupting biofilms and killing the constituent bacteria. These studies have led to the identification of several molecules that effectively disturb biofilm physiology, often by interrupting bacterial quorum sensing. In this manner, manipulation of innate and induced resistance pathways holds much promise for treatment of biofilm infections.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is one of the best documented examples of contemporary biological evolution. Variability in the mechanisms of resistance depends on the diversity of genotypes in the huge bacterial populations, and also on the diversity of selective pressures that are produced along the antibiotic concentration gradients formed in the highly compartmentalized human body during therapy. These antibiotic gradients can be conceived as comprising selective compartments, each one of them defined as the concentration able to select a particular genetic variant. In vitro experimental models confirm that some antibiotic resistant variants are selected only at certain selective concentrations of antibiotics. The correspondence between selective compartments and selectable variants could offer a way of describing more accurately the antibiotic selective landscapes and for taking measures to prevent the development of a major threat to the future of modern medicine.},

  Abstract                 = {A new apparatus is described which serves to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of antibiotics as a function of different concentration time curves. The apparatus can be adjusted to simulate the biexponential serum level curves observed in vivo after oral or intramuscular administration. Preliminary studies were carried out with a cephalosporin derivative, cefazolin, against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp. strains simulating initial concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 μg/ml that decreased exponentially with half-lives of 30, 60, and 120 min. Surviving cells were counted at 1-h intervals for 10 h. In all the situations tested there was an initial phase of rapid bactericidal activity followed by a phase of bacteriostatic activity, whose length depended on the drug elimination rate but was relatively independent of the initial concentrations. Bacterial regrowth occurred when the antibiotic concentration fell below the minimum inhibitory concentration of the drug against the strains tested. The antibacterial activity of cefazolin, cephacetrile, and cephradine against E. coli and Klebsiella strains was also investigated, in a medium containing 4% human albumin, simulating the serum level curves observed in humans after an intramuscular dose of 1 g. The results obtained suggest that, for cephalosporins, a longer half-life might be more useful than higher peak levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Author Summary Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the dominating pathogen of chronic airway infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Although bacterial long-term persistence in CF hosts involves mutation and selection of genetic variants with increased fitness in the CF lung environment, our understanding of the within-host evolutionary processes is limited. Here, we performed a retrospective study of the P. aeruginosa DK2 clone type, which is a transmissible clone isolated from chronically infected Danish CF patients over a period of 38 years. Whole-genome analysis of DK2 isolates enabled a fine-grained reconstruction of the recent evolutionary history of the DK2 lineage and an identification of bacterial genes targeted by mutations to optimize pathogen fitness. The identification of such pathoadaptive genes gives new insight into how the pathogen evolves under the selective pressures of the host immune system and drug therapies. Furthermore, isolates with increased rates of mutation (hypermutator phenotype) emerged in the DK lineage. While this phenotype may accelerate evolution, we also show that hypermutators display differential mutagenesis of certain genes which enable them to follow alternative evolutionary pathways. Overall, our study identifies genes important for bacterial persistence and provides insight into the different mutational mechanisms that govern the adaptive genetic changes.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Bacterial growth environment strongly influences the efficacy of antibiotic treatment, with slow growth often being associated with decreased susceptibility. Yet in many cases, the connection between antibiotic susceptibility and pathogen physiology remains unclear. We show that for ribosome‐targeting antibiotics acting on Escherichia coli, a complex interplay exists between physiology and antibiotic action; for some antibiotics within this class, faster growth indeed increases susceptibility, but for other antibiotics, the opposite is true. Remarkably, these observations can be explained by a simple mathematical model that combines drug transport and binding with physiological constraints. Our model reveals that growth‐dependent susceptibility is controlled by a single parameter characterizing the ‘reversibility’ of ribosome‐targeting antibiotic transport and binding. This parameter provides a spectrum classification of antibiotic growth‐dependent efficacy that appears to correspond at its extremes to existing binary classification schemes. In these limits, the model predicts universal, parameter‐free limiting forms for growth inhibition curves. The model also leads to non‐trivial predictions for the drug susceptibility of a translation mutant strain of E. coli, which we verify experimentally. Drug action and bacterial metabolism are mechanistically complex; nevertheless, this study illustrates how coarse‐grained models can be used to integrate pathogen physiology into drug design and treatment strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {Author Summary The use of antibiotics against bacterial infections has led to the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens such as tuberculosis and MRSA. In order to control resistance, clinicians have increasingly turned to multi-antibiotic therapies. The common wisdom is to use combinations of drugs that act synergistically to kill the infection, but the impact of drug synergy on the evolution of resistance is unclear. Using mathematical simulations of an in vivo infection model, we asked what level of drug synergy would minimize the risk of multi-drug resistance while preserving the efficacy of treatment. We found that synergy may increase or decrease the risk of multi-drug resistance in a given treatment, depending on infection properties such as mutation rate and the availability of resources. Surprisingly, under conditions of strong competition for resources within the host, we found that maximal synergy—currently favored in clinical settings—can actually increase the risk of multi-drug resistance. Our results identify conditions under which drug synergy exacerbates the problem of multi-drug resistance, and offer guidelines for the selection of drug pairs that suppress it.},

  Abstract                 = {Increasing resistance to antibiotics creates the need for prudent antibiotic use. When resistance to various antibiotics within a class is driven by stepwise accumulation of mutations, a dilemma may exist in regard to replacing an antibiotic that is losing effectiveness due to resistance with a new drug within the same class. Such replacement may enhance treatment success in the short term but promote the spread of highly resistant strains. We used mathematical models to quantify the tradeoff between minimizing treatment failures (by switching early) and minimizing the proliferation of the highly resistant strain (by delaying the switch). Numerical simulations were applied to investigate the cumulative prevalence of the highly resistant strain (Resistance) and the cumulative number of treatment failures (Failure) that resulted from following different antibiotic use policies. Whereas never switching to the new drug always minimizes Resistance and maximizes Failure, immediate switching usually maximizes Resistance and minimizes Failure. Thus, in most circumstances, there is a strict tradeoff in which early use of the new drug enhances treatment effectiveness while hastening the rise of high-level resistance. This tradeoff is most acute when acquired resistance is rare and the highly resistant strain is readily transmissible. However, exceptions occur when use of the new drug frequently leads to acquired resistance and when the highly resistant strain has substantial {\textquotedblleft}fitness cost{\textquotedblright}; these circumstances tend to favor an immediate switch. We discuss the implications of these considerations in regard to antibiotic choices for Streptococcus pneumoniae.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a serious global problem and includes strains of β‐lactam‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin‐resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Novel antimicrobials and/or new approaches to combat the problem are urgently needed. The Chinese herb Xi‐nan Huangqin (Scutellaria amoena CM. Wright) has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat a wide range of infectious diseases. In this study we have examined the antibacterial action of baicalin, a flavone isolated from the herb. When combined with 16 μg mL−1 baicalin, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of benzylpenicillin against MRSA and penicillin‐resistant S. aureus were reduced from 125 and 250 μg mL−1 to 4 and 16 μg mL−1, respectively. This activity of baicalin was dose‐dependent. Viable counts showed that the killing of MRSA and β‐lactam‐resistant S. aureus cells by 10 to 50 μgm mL−1 ampicillin, amoxycillin, benzylpenicillin, methicillin and cefotaxime was potentiated by 25 μg mL−1 baicalin. From the study it was concluded that baicalin has the potential to restore the effectiveness of β‐lactam antibiotics against MRSA and other strains of β‐lactam‐resistant S. aureus. In view of its limited toxicity baicalin offers potential for the development of a valuable adjunct to β‐lactam treatments against otherwise resistant strains of microorganisms.},
